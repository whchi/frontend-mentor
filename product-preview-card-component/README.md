## My process

### Built with

- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

1. use `<picture>` to load different images for different screen sizes
2. the `object-fit` property
3. the `::before` pseudo-elements is inline, so you need to set it to `display:inline-block` to make the `width` and `height` work when loading images
4. `font-family` loading order
